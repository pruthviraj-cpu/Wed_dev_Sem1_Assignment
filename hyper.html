        <div id="brand-content">
            <p>Formula Student is the world's largest engineering design competition for students, aimed at building a Formula-style race-car with rules provided by the organizing committee, ensuring safe on-site operation of the car. Students go from conceiving the ideas they want to implement in the car, to designing, manufacturing, and testing the car in a period of less than a year, with resources available from the school and industry partners, who are engaged in designing and manufacturing of automotive parts.</p>
            <p>Since 2011, we have been participating in different Formula Student events every year like Formula Bharat and SAE SUPRA India. The team has been steadily but consistently improving every year with a humble beginning of 19th Overall team to having consecutive podium finishes - 3rd Overall in SAE SUPRA 2018 to being the Champions of SAE SUPRA 2019 to again being the 2nd Overall Best Combustion Team in Formula Bharat 2020 to being National Champions at Formula Bharat 2023!! With our phenomenal performance in the season of 2022-23, we have now joined the club of elite combustion teams in India, which don't just work for winning but strive for creativity, innovation, excellence in engineering & operations, team building & hence achieve high performance. We focus on not just improving ourselves, but all our members empowering them to develop themselves to become industry-ready. Our motto- Never Give Up is at the heart of our team, and we believe that it is not yet over but a lot more to come, hence we work towards continuously developing ourselves and help our peer teams in the Formula Student Community. #FSspirit.</p>
